This is a Monogame project. It's very rough at the moment but it's a work in progress for the entertainment and educational factors.

I wouldn't expect any of this code to be world class at the time being, but it will get refactored and cleaned up as I go once I figure out the best ways to create certain aspects of the engine.

The current dependencies are:
* Monogame
* Json.NET
* A Direct X runtime (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
